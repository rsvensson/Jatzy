# Jatzy
Yahtzee-like game written in Java

Made for a Java course I took. Written using Netbeans 8.x and JDK 8.

The rules are based on the Swedish version of the game, called [Yatzy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yatzy). Up to three players can play. Roll the dice and select the dice you want to keep for the next throw. When done, just click on the table row you want to save the score to.
